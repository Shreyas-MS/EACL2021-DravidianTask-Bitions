This repo contains implementation for the paper "Bitions@DravidianLangTech-EACL2021: Ensemble of Multilingual Language Models with Pseudo Labeling for Offence Detection in Dravidian Languages" to be presented at EACL-2021 

In this paper, we propose use of ensembled multilingual models (transformers) with focal loss and inverse class weights. Further, we make use of psuedo labelling to improve our results.
